Complete the following steps to import the datafile:
\begin{enumerate}
^^I\item Direct Stata to the datafile by selecting \textbf{Browse..}
^^I\item Choose the delimiter (the symbol that Stata recognises as separating individual data observations) - automatic is usually best
^^I\item Just in the case with XLS/X files, if the first row represents the variable names, choose always under the appropriate option
^^I\item Observe the preview and if everything looks in its proper format, press OK
\end{enumerate}
